# Keypro Assigment Backend

I built a simple server for the test. Due to it being an MVP and just an extra bonus for the Frontend role, I didn't adhere to the proper architecture patterns like MVC or Repository pattern

## Usage

### Enviroment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change configure

### Development

```bash
# Required: typescript watch compilation
$ npm run watch

# Required: development server with hot reload (nodemon)
$ npm run dev

# Format with prettier
$ npm run format
```

### Production

```bash
# build for production
$ npm run build

# start production app
$ npm run start
```
